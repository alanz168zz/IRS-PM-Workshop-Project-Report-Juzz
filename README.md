# SECTION 1: PROJECT TITLE
## Chatbot And Machine Learning For Data Classification For Juzz Marketing

# SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Juzz Marketing is a marketing agency that provides lead generation services to business owners, property agents and financial advisors. The website has multiple web pages that provide a lot of information about their lead generation services. However, when a user visits the website, they could get confused and have no idea what to look for.

Based on the google analytics, the website has a 4% bounce rate which means that for every 25 visitors who visited the website, 1 of them will exit the website after viewing 1 page. Whenever a user tries to WhatsApp Juzz for enquiry, it will take hours for them to reply due to manpower shortage. Juzz could be potentially losing customers due to this issue and we have to find possible solutions to fix this problem. Juzz also do not have a sitemap to assist user in the navigation.

Juzz has a huge consumer database that consists of only name and mobile generated for its clients and wish to seek more meaningful information from this such as finding out their gender using artificial intelligence instead of manually input. There is a need to do **gender classification** because there may be some clients who like to target specific gender. Take for example, a facial spa that provides their services only to females may want to target all female customers only.

The services that Juzz Marketing provides are Digital Marketing, Telemarketing, Flyers Distribution and Event Marketing and its customers can be classified into 3 main categories - Financial advisors, Property Agents and Business Owners.

Juzz Chatbot is created to help solve this problem. When someone visits the website, Juzz Chatbot will interact with them and start to ask them questions. Google Dialog flow will be used to integrate with WhatsApp Business for the chatbot design.
